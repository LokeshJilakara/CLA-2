The code is for a Photography Portfolio Website. It includes a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a user-friendly, visually appealing, and interactive website. Here’s an overview of its components and functionality:
HTML Structure
Navigation Bar: Includes links to different sections of the website (Home, Gallery, About, Contact) for easy navigation.

Hero Section: A full-screen banner image with a heading and a button that links to the gallery section.

About Me Section: A brief introduction to the photographer with a portrait image and a description of their work and passion.

Photography Categories: Three key photography categories (Portrait, Landscape, and Event Photography) with descriptive cards.

Gallery Section: A grid of images, with each image clickable to open a larger version in a modal (lightbox).

Testimonials Section: A showcase of client feedback or reviews about the photographer's work.

Contact Section: A contact form where users can input their name, email, phone number, and message to get in touch with the photographer.

Social Media Links: Links to the photographer’s Facebook and Instagram profiles.

CSS Styling
The design leverages Bootstrap 5 for responsiveness, ensuring the layout adapts well to different screen sizes.

Custom CSS styles are applied to sections such as the hero image, navigation bar, form elements, and hover effects on images.

The site uses clean typography with Google Fonts for a modern and appealing look.

Hover effects are applied on images and cards to add interactive behavior.

JavaScript Functionality
Form Validation: The contact form includes JavaScript code that validates user inputs (name, email, phone number, and message). It ensures that only valid data is submitted and alerts the user if something is incorrect (e.g., invalid email, incorrect phone number format).

Image Lightbox: The gallery section includes a lightbox feature, where clicking on an image opens it in a modal for a larger view.

Event Listeners: JavaScript is used to handle form submission and prevent the default form action to allow custom validation.
